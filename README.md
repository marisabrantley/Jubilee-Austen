# Jubilee Austen Project

The Jubilee Austen Project is a single-page (non-responsive) mock portfolio website. The project took us from coding, based on a Photoshop PSD, to launching it.

## Objective

It introduced us to using a text editor, Photoshop, setting up structure and content with HTML, styling with CSS, validating and testing our code, 
obtaining a domain, and ultimately launching the website.
